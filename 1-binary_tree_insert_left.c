/**
 * binary_tree_insert_left - Write a func that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
 *
 * @parent: is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
 * @value: is the value to store in the new node
 *
 * Description - If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place,
 * and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.
 *
 * Return: return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
